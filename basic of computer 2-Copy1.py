get_ipython().set_next_input('1 )What is diffrence between RAM and ROM');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'ROM')
Ans:1)RAM is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order,
    typically used to store working data and machine code.
    
    2)ROM is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.
    
get_ipython().set_next_input('2 )What is memory?What is primary and secondary memory');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'memory')
Ans:Memory unit is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit.
    This storage capacity is expressed in terms of Bytes.There are 2 types of memory primary and secondary
    memory 
    1)Primary memory is the main memory of the computer which can be directly accessed by the central processing unit.
    
    2)Secondary memory refers to the external storage device which can be used to store data or information permanently.
    
3 )Abbriviate the following:
    a.CPU:CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
    b.GPU:GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT
    c.SSD:SOLID STATE DRIVES
    d.RAM:RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY
    e.ROM:READ ONLY MEMORY
    f.PROM:PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY
    g.EPROM:ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY
    h.EEPROM:ELETRICALLY ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY
        
get_ipython().set_next_input('4 )What is a keyboard?What are its function keys and what purpose do they serve');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'serve')
Ans:Function Keys are keys on keyboard which cause operating system to command interpreter or
    an application to perform certain actions on the screen.There are 12 keys on the keyboard
    from F1 to F12.All keys are having different functions to perform.
    
get_ipython().set_next_input('5 )What is a printer? How do you connect it? What is the shortcut key to print');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'print')
Ans:A printer is a hardware output device that is used to generate hard copy and print any document.

    .Click the Printer drop-down arrow, and select the printer you want to connect to.
         The shortcut key to print is {Ctrl-P}
        
get_ipython().set_next_input('6 )What are the types of printer');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'printer')
Ans:There are 2 types of printer :
    .impact
    .non impact
    
get_ipython().set_next_input('7 )What is a light pen?Describe its functions');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'functions')
Ans:A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light-sensitive wand use
    in conjunction with a computer's  cathode-ray tube (CRT) display. It allows the user
    to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar wayto a touchscreen
    but with greater positional accuracy.
